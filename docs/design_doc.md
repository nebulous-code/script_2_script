# Rust Render (WIP)

This is a rust library and workspace that allows users to program a 2D video. 

## Workflows

Users can import the rust_render library and then load up images, raylib shapes and object, and other mp4 files and move them around on the screen using an XY cordinate system. 


## Technicals

Uses raylib to render graphics and ffmpeg to convert it into an mp4 file.
